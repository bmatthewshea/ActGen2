## Installation

    The EXE can be placed anywhere. %appdata%\ActGen\?\user.config is used for saved settings.
	I have an installer built but is not part of this repo.

## Features

- Generate optionally with letters, numbers, and symbols (add as extra characters).
- Can use dashes and set breaks in the generated code.
- Can save settings for quicker use later.

## TO-DO

- Fix the background worker problem / RNGCryptoServiceProvider - this should speed up generation.
- basic code clean up - currently a mess -> you were warned.
